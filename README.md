# Project Description
**Duplicate text-pair Detection Mechanism**
1) This is a Machine Learning (ML) Project focused at Natural Language Processing (NLP).
2) A prediction model is built using the stream-lit module of python that finds out whether an entered pair of questions are a duplicate of each other or not.
3) This use-case helps websites like Quora and StackOverflow to effectively eliminate duplicate questions from their site, and provides a clean User Interface.
4) Quora dataset from kaggle is used.
5) Data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis is performed over it to obtain a good accuracy score.
6) Random forest classifier and XGB classifier algorithms are used to compare the accuracy percentage.
7) **Project Report** is provided to depict the detailed analysis & presentation of the project.

**Technologies Used:**
1. Front End: Stream-lit module of python
2. Backend: Python Programming
3. Dataset: Quora dataset from kaggle
